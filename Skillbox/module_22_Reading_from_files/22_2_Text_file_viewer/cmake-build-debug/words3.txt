I'm having a great time here in Sydney. The different sports are exciting, and there are lots of other exciting things too. For example the mascots are really great! They are called Olly, Syd and Millie. They are Australian animals and they are the symbols of the Sydney Games. The kookaburra is an Australian bird. She got her name, Olly, from the word 'Olympics'. She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna.

She's a symbol of friendship and honesty. Then there Syd (from Sydney). He's the symbol of the city of Sydney and its people. The third mascot is Millie. She's an Australian animal an echidna. She's the symbol of the new millennium. So now I've got a mascot too. He's called Ozzie (from Australia) and he's a cute, cuddly koala.
